[**Markdown**](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics) is a text-to-HTML conversion tool for web writers. 
It converts the plain text formatting to HTML.

#### 1. Easy to read

#### 2. Easy to write 

These are all we need to write just our thoughts and **Markdown** have these.

Let's see Markdown's syntax.

### Headers ###

# Text #
 
## Text

##### Text
    # Text
	  ## Text
    ##### Text

### Blockquotes

> Lorem ipsum
    > Lorem ipsum

More and more, then speed up .:)

A First Level Header
====================

A Second Level Header
---------------------

Now is the time for all good men to come to
the aid of their country. This is just a
regular paragraph.

The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy
dog's back.

### Header 3

> This is a blockquote.
> 
> This is the second paragraph in the blockquote.
>
> ## This is an H2 in a blockquote
~~~

Then see output.:
