[**Markdown**](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics) is a text-to-HTML conversion tool for web writers. 
It converts the plain text formatting to HTML.

#### 1. Easy to read

#### 2. Easy to write 

These are all we need to write just our thoughts and **Markdown** have these.

Let's see Markdown's syntax.

## Paragraphs, Headers, Blockquotes

First of all, we will see how we write on our .md file.

~~~
A First Level Header
====================

A Second Level Header
---------------------

Now is the time for all good men to come to
the aid of their country. This is just a
regular paragraph.

The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy
dog's back.

### Header 3

> This is a blockquote.
> 
> This is the second paragraph in the blockquote.
>
> ## This is an H2 in a blockquote
~~~

Then see output.:

### Header 3

> This is a blockquote.
> 
> This is the second paragraph in the blockquote.
>
> ## This is an H2 in a blockquote

## Phrase Emphasis

That is how we write emphasized words.

~~~
Some of these words *are emphasized*.
Some of these words _are emphasized also_.

Use two asterisks for **strong emphasis**.
Or, if you prefer, __use two underscores instead__.

Here is output.:

This is an [example link](example.com)

I get 10 times more traffic from [Google][1] than from
[Yahoo][2] or [MSN][3].

[1]: http://google.com/        "Google"
[2]: http://search.yahoo.com/  "Yahoo Search"
[3]: http://search.msn.com/    "MSN Search"
